# to-do
Features:
- A project contains a list of various todos.
- Each project renders in its own different page.
- Navigate/add/delete projects pages by using the sidebar (which is collapsable on mobile).
- Within the heading of the project page, there is a button to add a to-do.
- Each to-do element includes a checkbox, its title, the due date, a button to display more of its details, a button to edit it, and a button to delete it.

- Categories filter to-dos by a certain criteria. For example, the important category contains only to-dos with a priority number of 3.
- Categories, like projects, render in their own pages, which can be selected from the sidebar; but unlike projects, they cannot be added or deleted by the user.
- You cannot manually add a todo to a category, nor can you edit/delete a todo. You can only see its details.

- All project data is stored in the user's local storage, and loaded from the JSON when the user visits the app again.
