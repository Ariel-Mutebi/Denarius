# Denarius the to-do list app

## History

1. I created this app's predecessor, [TaskQuest](https://github.com/black-RAM/TaskQuest/) from September 22, 2023 to December 13, 2023. It was my solution to [this Odin Project assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list#assignment). But I got too many ideas for extra features and went above and beyond the project specifications, and the app grew into my biggest yet.

2. Precisely one year later, I was wondering what to do for the exceedingly ambiguous [Inventory Application assignment from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-inventory-application). I remembered my magnum opus and decided to return to magnify it further by polishing it and conferring upon it an API which would enable cloud storage.

3. I polished the app like a cobbler. I enacted the "Refactor of Versailles", emphasizing modularity and good design principles. I tested each module with a chemist's scrupulousness. I drew UML diagrams like an architect. I made the user experience more consistent like a gardener pruning a topiary. I renamed the app to "Denarius" like a business man trying to strengthen his brand's identity.

4. But, when I got to the API, I realized I was a lion who'd bitten off more than he could chew on the back-end. I was not armed with the sharp incisors of knowledge about API security, user authentication, session management, and what have you. So, as of now (Friday 27 December, 2024), I have decided to let this buffalo live on a few more days, in the meanwhile, strengthen my jaws by progressing further in the TOP curriculum and hunting down smaller project-animals.
